            <p>Sometimes we are asked, "Wow, <span class='nicolinetsound'>NicoliNet</span> is a really grate website. Surely you must have a ton of employees working hard on it 24/7." And, of course, the answer to that is, we do! This page is meant to give credit to our extensive amount of employees who have helped (however little) on our very important job here at <span class='nicolinetsound'>NicoliNet</span>.</p>

            <h3 class="employeeName">The Grate Nicoli <br></h3>
            <h4 class="employeeJob">Founder and All-Around Savage Brochacho<br></h4>
            <p class="employeeDescription">The Grate Nicoli, as you probably already know, is a pretty legit dude. He is the Chief Editor of all of the excellent content that you have here on NicoliNet today. He also happens to be a professional in literally everything, so, you know, that's pretty good. He also happens to be the main programmer of all of NicoliNet, and the founder of this beautiful website you are on here today.</p>

            <h3 class="employeeName">Blackout<br></h3>
            <h4 class="employeeJob">Memologist In Chief (M.I.C.)<br></h4>
            <p class="employeeDescription">As you can tell from the profile picture, our employee "Blackout" is most worthy of the title of M.I.C. (No, he definitely didn't bribe us or anything.) The title of M.I.C. is one of the highest one can hold at NicoliNet, giving them lots of important jobs, we assure you. In addition, they are being paid 10 times as much as all of the other employees (10 x 0 is still 0). We also think that their job description might have something to do with providing us with memes, but, you know, we're not really sure. So, like, yeah, I guess "Blackout" has a very important job indeed.</p>

            <h3 class="employeeName">Grandmaster<br></h3>
            <h4 class="employeeJob">???<br></h4>
            <p class="employeeDescription">"Grandmaster" is our most mysterious employee. Even The Grate Nicoli is not entirely sure what his job is here at NicoliNet. However, our records do state that "Grandmaster" has been most helpful in the creation of NicoliNet... somehow. If "Grandmaster" is reading this, you might want to, you know, actually tell us what the heck you do here all day for your high wage of 0 XDG (which means Dogecoin, as I'm sure you knew already).</p>

            <h4 class="employeeJob">Chief Janitorial Officer (CJO)<br></h4>
            <p class="employeeDescription">As the CJO of NicoliNet, "XxFortnite_GamerxX" helps to keep our extensive premises clean. Without "XxFortnite_GamerxX", all of our 3000 acres of office space that we have would quickly be covered up with dust and uncleanliness in general. Luckily for us, "XxFortnite_GamerxX" readily volunteered for the important job of CJO, very eager to have a role in the world's most important and influential company, NicoliNet (oh yes). Unfortunately, however, that's really the maximum I can write about janitorial services, so, like that's pretty much it for "XxFortnite_GamerxX"'s job description.</p>
